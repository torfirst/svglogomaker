# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

This project allows a user to generate a simple logo as a svg file.

## Credits

I referenced [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Basic_Shapes#rectangle) to figure out how to create a SVG file.

I also received guidance from the Xpert Learning Assistant on BCS. I also referenced code from previous class activities.
